<h2>Moped Dashboard Computer 1:</h2>
Tracks speed, mileage, fuel level, distance-to-empty, battery, time, ..., as well as controlling 
headlamp, tail lamp, signal lights, horn, charging (including rectification, regulation from the bike's 
alternator, with a USB port to charge your phone while riding.)

<p>It also contains a motion-sensing theft alarm/disabler.

<p>I put about 10,000 km on a bike running this dashboard, with no issues.

<p>All fonts, drivers, etc., written from scratch.

<h2>String Theory Chord Finder</h2>
<p>(Feature of the optical guitar tuner.)
<p>Not just a reference table, but dynamically generated chord fingering, finding the best chord 
based upon current guitar tuning, your finger reach (or even how many fingers you have!)
<p>All fonts, drivers, etc., written from scratch.

<h2>Tuner Technology Demonstration</h2>
Early tech demonstration of polychromatic optical guitar tuner.  Each LED is precisely set to the
desired frequency; if a string is in tune, it will appear stationary.  Any out of tune
strings will appear to be in motion (the more out of tune, the faster the apparent motion.

<p>You can instantly see if any strings are out of tune (and how badly) with a single strum.
For electric guitars, no interfacing with the output signal is required (as per traditional tuners),
and the guitar can be quickly tuned even with the amplifier disconnected or off!  
(Great for tuning on-stage.)

<p>(Since filming the stroboscopic effect at 30 fps wouldn't work, this demo is done by tuning 
all the strings to multiples of 30hz, hence the odd sounds.  The effect is more dramatic
viewed directly.)
